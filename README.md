# Overview of the Functionality
For this assignment, we created a GUI that was able to draw graphics to the form that displayed information sent from a server for an Agario knockoff game. We had a logger 
to log events when TCP networking was used and when the game world was updated. We had different model classes to abstract the game world and other game objects like players
and food.

# Comments to Evaluators:

We tried our best to learn how to do the graphics and drawing but we had a lot of issues even doing the practice exercises 1-3. They took much longer than 15 minutes each
despite starting early on the assignment. This caused us to be delayed us on the rest of the assignment and even
trying to draw food objects for the game has been difficult for us. We can also sometimes draw players and such but we still are unsure what is going wrong with everything.


# Consulted Peers:

We consulted each other as partners.


# Partnership:

So far, all work has been done during pair programming! We met over Zoom and worked together on this assignment throughout.


# Branches:

No branches at this time.


# Examples of Good Software Practice:

1. We made sure to use very descriptive names for methods and variables
2. We made sure to abstract away some methods that had to do with updating the world that the player/client exists in.


# Best Team Practices:

We were able to switch off programming and help each other when the other was typing. We traded off rewatching lectures, consulting notes, Piazza, and the internet in order to help
each other make progress on the assignment.


# Time Expenditures:

    1. Assignment Eight:   Predicted Hours:       20         Actual Hours:  30  (pair programming the entire time)
